This is the very first post and it's Christmas. It's also called "Hello World" because I'm a computer programmer, hence the pun.

This is the induction to the upcoming blogs on computer science, C++, life and more. I love to make my life vivid and I'm open to experiences {except the bad ones}, but you know they happen. Time and a flavourful professional experience has taught me many things, some of them I'm really good at, some of them.. ah never mind.

As you know I make games... wait you didn't knew. I dare you check my about page, I spent 30 mins on selecting the images, I'm that busy.

A lot of thoughts cross my mind everyday, now I can make a YouTube video for each one of them, but cache is somewhat important for programmers and my system. So, I made the coolest looking, laziest working website, as I only have to edit markdown files for posts. 

On second thought, our technical experitise (bricks) is held together by the glue (character) which shapes what kind of structures (life experiences) we build. - I said this don't copy.

In upcoming blogs I'll share with you all a bit of everything that I learn.
Do spend time with your family and friends, there's more to life than banging your fingers on keyboard... okay I'm leaving.

Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

# Pabitra Padhy

How was your day !!

I work as a Software Engineer/Game Programmer. When I was in school, I saw my friends playing video games. The idea of creating games was so vivid that I pursued my dream, learned programming in college and started making games. Yes, just like that.

I did something amazing, an unwavering commitment as a child to something I love and I put every ounce of my energy behind it to live my dream. I found my passion. It's a 16 years journey from that day.

I love spending my time learning and getting better at my craft everyday. And yes that's not my home, but you could send a hefty cheque, I don't mind.
